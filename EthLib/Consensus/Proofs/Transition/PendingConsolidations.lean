# Pending consolidation sources and lifecycle

Every pending source remains in the validator registry along a run before Gloas.

Electra starts an empty queue, requests append existing indices, and processing drops a prefix.

With positive withdrawal delay, sources are distinct and keep their activation and exit ordering.

An assigned exit prevents a source from being queued twice, and slashing only delays withdrawal.

The queue is in the order of its sources' exits, so no pending source can withdraw yet.
