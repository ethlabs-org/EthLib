# Proofs: honest validators that run the fork choice over the network

Each honest validator keeps a store of the fork choice.

At each move it ticks its store to the current time, or processes a message of its view.

The messages are those of the fork choice handlers.

A block is processed with the votes and slashings that it carries.

The block is rejected with them when one of them is rejected.

A message that the handler rejects leaves the store as it was, and may be processed later.

What lies outside the beacon chain, such as the execution engine, is one source for all.

The store of each honest validator stays reachable from the anchor along every execution.

Along an execution of the network model, an honest store that starts with a forward clock keeps one.

/-- The moves of the store of an honest validator, at a time and with a view.

A tick sets the store to the time, which must fit in 64 bits.

That time must not lie before the clock of the store.

Every other move processes a message of the view, as one from the network.

The votes inside a block are processed with it, and a rejected vote rejects the block.

Blocks and envelopes are judged with the given sources outside the beacon chain. -/

/-- Honest validators that run the fork choice have an execution where a block reaches all.

No message carries a signed statement here, so unforgeability asks nothing.

Each validator starts from a store built from an anchor, and the clock starts at its time.

An honest validator sends a block from an empty view, as the protocol allows.

Two events later every validator has the block, with the clock and the stores as at the start.

The stores stay reachable.

There the honest validator may also move to its own store, when slots last a positive time.

The execution is partially synchronous for every GST and every positive delay. -/
