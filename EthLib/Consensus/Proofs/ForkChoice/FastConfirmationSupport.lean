# Statements: the honest support of a confirmed block reaches each honest store

This file states steps 4 and 5 of the plan for the safety of the fast confirmation rule.

The rule is that of [arXiv 2405.00549v4][fcr].

The proofs of step 5 are placeholders, and each statement of step 5 may still change.

Step 4 joins two proved bounds on a one-confirmed block, and its proof is complete.

Count the honest supporters of the block twice, and add the honest voters for its parent.

The sum exceeds the weight of the committees of the block plus the boost.

Step 5 carries that bound from the store of the caller to each honest store at a later time.

An honest vote that the caller holds reaches each honest store before the next slot.

While the block is on the chain of each honest head, each new honest vote supports it.

So the bound holds in each honest store, with the committees of the slots since.

The head of such a store then descends from the block, when the store has not filtered it out.

That last step is the store form of Lemma 2 of the paper, and this file takes it as a hypothesis.

In [verified-fast-confirmation][vfc], step 5 is `safeFrom_of_headStep_at` with its lemmas.

There the set of validators and their balances are fixed, and one function gives the committees.

Here each store reads committees and balances from its own states.

So step 5 asks that they agree.

/-- Step 4: the honest support of a one-confirmed block, without the discount of the rule.

The honest voters for the parent come from the committees between the parent and the block.

Each of the two ranges of committees has at most β of its stake Byzantine, Assumption 2.

The other hypotheses are those of the two bounds that the proof joins. -/

/-- The head of an honest store follows the honest support of a block, Lemma 2 in the store.

The store is up to date, and the parent of the block is on the chain of its head.

The block is in the filtered tree of the store.

The committees are those from the slot after the parent to the slot before the current one.

Count the honest supporters of the block twice, and add the honest voters for its parent.

The sum exceeds the weight of those committees plus the boost.

The balances are those of the justified state of the store.

Then the block is on the chain of the head.

The tree part of Lemma 2 in issue 1458 is to give this fact.

It needs a cap on the weight of a sibling.

/-- The stores of the honest validators weigh a block as the caller of the rule does.

The caller weighs with the state of its observed justified checkpoint, the source of balances.

Each honest store from a first time to a last one has a bounded loss of support margin.

In each of them, the Byzantine validators hold at most β of each range of committees.

This is Assumption 2.

Here β is the threshold of the configuration, in percent.

No honest validator is a known equivocator of such a store.

The shift compares the same honest subsets and committee set in two balance states.

It bounds the loss of twice the supporters plus the parent voters, less committees and boost.

For each fixed subset pair, gains inside that pair can offset its losses.

The bound holds for every pair, so gains outside a losing subset cannot cancel its loss.

The caller must have that much extra margin; equality of all balances is not required. -/

/-- Step 5, the transport: the bound of step 4 holds in each honest store at a later time.

The caller is an honest validator whose store is up to date and holds the bound of step 4.

Its ranges of committees end at the slot before its own, and at the slot before the block.

From the time of the call to just before the later time, the block is safe.

So each honest vote of those slots supports the block.

The receiver is an honest validator whose store is up to date at the later time.

Its ranges of committees end at the slot before its own, and at the slot before the block.

The honest validators vote as their duty asks from the start of the execution.

Each honest store starts as the same store, which holds no vote.

The proof follows three lemmas of [verified-fast-confirmation][vfc].

Two are `honest_supporters_sum_le_Sval_window` and `weak_base_discharged_window`.

The third is `bval_endpoint_strip_window_uniform`.

The counting step `honest_ratio_of_new_votes` takes the place of its fixed committees.

/-- Step 5, the induction: a block that holds the bound of step 4 is safe up to a last time.

The caller and its bound are those of `Execution.honest_support_of_safe`.

The parent of the block is safe from the time of the call to the last time.

Take a time of that range such that the block is safe at each earlier time of the range.

Then each honest store holds the block in its filtered tree or below its justified block.

Step 6 gives that fact from the other checks of the rule.

The proof is a strong induction on the time.

It follows `safeFrom_of_headStep_at` of [verified-fast-confirmation][vfc].

/-- A complete later duty epoch makes each assigned honest tally voter support the safe prefix.

The tally state may be old; no comparison with the caller's balances is used.

The head block is admitted before the next boundary, and its vote is recorded at that boundary.

This is the late support step of arXiv 2405.00549v4, Lemma 2.

The statement is under review; head admission must be derived, not assumed as vote delivery. -/
