# Proofs: the latest vote of a validator never goes back

This module proves that handlers preserve latest votes and never lower their rank.

The paper's latest-vote filter is in [arXiv 2405.00549v4, Section 3.1, LMD-GHOST][fcr].

A store keeps one latest vote for each validator.

A vote replaces it only with a later rank: the target epoch before Gloas, the slot from Gloas.

So no handler removes a latest vote, and none lowers its rank.

An attester slashing adds equivocators, and leaves the latest votes as they are.

Along an execution of the network model, the same holds for each honest validator.

For an implementation comparison, [verified-fast-confirmation][vfc] has two related declarations.

They are `StoreLE` and `Execution.store_latest_message_ge_mono`.
